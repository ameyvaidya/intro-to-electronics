# A Developer's Introduction to Electronics

Are you a programmer? Odds are you have a love of Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, and other devices of their ilk. These devices are easy to program, especially for a developer like you, but when it comes to building circuits for them to control, you're pretty much just following recipes online without a lot of understanding of what's going on. This talk will correct that.

In it, I'm going to explain the basics of electronics and the components that are commonly used to build circuits. I'll starts with Ohm's Law and will then cover basic components including resitors, diodes, capacitors, transforms, relays, and transistors. I'll use these components to build some basic circuits and explain them. And, I'll control these circuits from an Arduino and my laptop to show them in action!

When we're done, you'll be able to build circuits that you can use for your own projects *and* have the knowledge on how they work. You won't know everything, but you'll have a wonderful start in learning to make and *understand* more complex circuits!
